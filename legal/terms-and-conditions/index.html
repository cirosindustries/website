		<h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
		<h3>Last updated Thursday 10th November 2022</h3>
		
		<h2>AGREEMENT TO TERMS</h2>
		<p>Â¨By purchasing ANY of our products, you agree to the following terms & conditions stated below:
		</p>
		
		<h2>SECTION 1, GENERAL</h2>
		<p>1.1 - You are not permitted to use any products sold in this server without a valid license issued by one of our official Administrators.
       1.2 - You are not permitted to leak any products.
       1.3 - You are not permitted to resell any products.
       1.4 - You are not permitted to send any products to non-associates of your group (examples are friends, non-developers, etc.)
       1.5 - We reserve the right to remove your license at any time if you have broken any rules, or T&C's WITHOUT a refund.
       1.6 - BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK: If you get leaked and there are our products in that leak, you can be held responsible.
       1.7 - You can only use a product if the game owner is whitelisted. If it's a group, then the group owner must be whitelisted.
       1.8 - Refunds are not given unless there is a good reason.
       1.9 - You can only use a product if the game owner is whitelisted. If it's a group, then the group owner must be whitelisted.
       2.0 - We can remove your whitelist at any time without refund - This can be for any reason given by an administrator, even if it is not in our terms and conditions. You have the right to complain about this if you feel this is invalid.</p>
		
		<h2>SECTION 2, TRANSFERRING</h2>
		<p>2.1 - The transfer cap for any product is 2 transfers per person. If you have transferred a certain product twice, you will not be able to transfer it again.
       2.2 - You are not permitted to give the person you intend to transfer the product to the product before it is officially transferred by a member of staff.
       2.3 - No turning back - if you transfer your product to someone else you cannot take it back unless the person you transferred it to transfers it back to you.
       2.4 - You are not permitted to do a 'trade', even if you have the license transferred officially. If we find you have traded it, the license will simply stay with you.</p>
		
		<h2>SECTION 3, GROUP HOLDERS</h2>
		<p>3.1 - If a group uses a Group Holder (a placeholder player owned by the owner of a group whom the ownership is given to), and you purchase a product for that group, you have the rights to the license being transferred to your Group Holder without your transfer cap being affected. This is only valid if you own the group but utilise a group holder. You must let staff know this upon transferring the product and you are required to send evidence of it being your group holder for your transfer cap to remain untouched.</p>
		
		<h2>SECTION 4, DMCA</h2>
		<p>4.1 - If anything custom is made for you, you run the risks of being moderated by ROBLOX over DMCA material. This is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY; a refund will not be issued if it is taken down for this reason.</p>

		<h2>PURCHASE</h2>
		<p>By purchasing any product, you agree to all the terms & conditions above.</p>
